				Members of households with an existing or recent Ufotable membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers.
				 We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Ufotable membership to determine Offer eligibility.

				You must be at least 18 years of age  to become a member of the Ufotable service. Minors may only use the service under the supervision of an adult.
				The Ufotable service and any content accessed through the service are for your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household unless otherwise allowed by your subscription plan. 
				During your Ufotable membership we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the Ufotable service and Ufotable content. Except for the foregoing, no right, title or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the service for public performances.
				<br><br>
				You may access the Ufotable content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content. 
				For the purpose of determining the taxes that will be charged over your subscription fee, we will use the IP address that is used when you sign up to the Ufotable service. 
				The content that may be available will vary by geographic location and will change from time to time. The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is specified on the Account page.	
				The Ufotable service, including the content library, is regularly updated and we may give you the opportunity to watch live or special events (including replays of such content) or to enjoy new additional features.
